- Customers

  We ran into a problem when we tried to just imagine a Customer with one Address, but Since A customer should be able
  to order deliveries to different addresses, we tried to look at it this way:


## Analysis of given Data

### Things that stood out

* No File for Customers or addresses -> All just part of the order Files.
* Each Product had a boolean if it was either spicy or vegetarian.
* The file with the branches was just a text file with all the addresses of the branches.
* Different kinds of ingredients can just be imported into the new database.


## Normalisation

Normalisation is a guideline to avoid data redundancy and avoid dataloss. If we take a look the orders work, we can
apply some normalisation to simplify this process. An Order exists of multiple parts:

1NF
